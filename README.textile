h1. Ruby Workspaces

Essentially, this is an implementation of Smalltalk Workspaces for Ruby. 

A Ruby Workspace is a simple text editor. You can mix text and Ruby code, save and load files etc. Select Ruby code and right click to execute it in various ways. 

It's a very useable alternative to IRB.

Enjoy!
